<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
If in doubt about the physical health of the disc it is recommended to appeal to specialists. 
Further work with the disk (including starting up) may worsen the problem 
or cause complete inability to recover data.
<a href="sysrequire.html#size">If device size is detected incorrectly</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
Do not load operating system, install or run the program on a partition
where lost or damaged data is located (data to recovery), 
otherwise it may be erased irrevocably.
<br />
To prevent writing to the problem disk
it is highly recommended to load the system 
from the removable media (LiveCD/USB, bootable DOS disk, etc.).
</p>

<p>
To install and run the program just extract entire software package into a single directory
(may be on removable media) and run <span class="tt">dmde.exe</span> or <span class="tt">dmde</span> 
depending on a version. You need Aministrator/Superuser priveleges to access devices in Windows NT+, Linux.
To run the software without Adminstrator rights (to work with images only)
add the parameter <span class="tt">notadmin=1</span> to the file <span class="tt">dmde.ini</span>.
</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<h3><a id="Windows"></a><a id="Win98"></a>Windows 98/ME</h3>
<p>
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
Without special patches Windows 9x/ME handles 128GB and larger drives incorrectly.<br />
To avoid the problem reload computer in MS-DOS mode and use DMDE for DOS  
to access such drives via BIOS or ATA-interface or load another OS.
</p>

<h3><a id="WinXP"></a>Windows 2K/XP</h3>
<p>
To use the program you should login as Administrator. <br />
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
To work with 128GB and larger drives you need Windows 2K SP4 with LBA48 support manually switched on 
in the registers or Windows XP SP2 (LBA48 is switched on by default).
</p>

<h3><a id="Win7"></a>Windows Vista/7/8</h3>
<p>
To run the program as Administrator right-click the program icon and use the corresponding
command in the context menu or confirm UAC elevation request.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
To work with drives larger than 2TB under Windows Vista/7/8
the most recent versions of controller drivers must be installed.
</p>

<h3><a id="Linux"></a>Linux</h3>
<p>
At first go to the Root Terminal or run Terminal emulator (Konsole, Gnome-terminal, etc.). 
Go to the software directory and type <span class="tt">./dmde</span>. 
You should run the software as a superuser to access devices. 
Please, refer to your operating system documentation for this information 
(e.g., run <span class="tt">sudo ./dmde</span> in Ubuntu, go to root with <span class="tt">su</span> command in Debian at first, etc.). 
You may also need to set execution permission for the file <span class="tt">dmde</span> (type <span class="tt">chmod 755 ./dmde</span>).
To run 32-bit software versions on 64-bit operating systems 
you may have to install additional 32-bit shared libraries 
(e.g., run <span class="tt">sudo apt-get install libc6-i386</span> in Ubuntu to install <span class="tt">libc6-i386</span> package).
</p>

<h3><a id="DOS"></a>DOS</h3>
<p>
You may use DMDE on a regular partition supported by DOS or use DOS bootable disk.
This may be helpful when there are problems using specific disk.
SATA disks must be switched to IDE-compatible mode in BIOS settings for direct ATA-access.
SCSI, USB, and other devices may be accessed via special DOS drivers or 
using BIOS functions if they are supported.
</p>
<p>
Some files for creating DOS boot disks are available on the <a href="about.html">software site</a>
in the section <a href="http://dmde.com/moredownload.html" target="_blank">Additional Downloads</a>.
</p>
<h4>Bootable Floppy</h4>
<p>
To create bootable floppy download and unpack <b>FDD image</b>.
You may use the function <a href="copysectors.html">Copy Sectors</a> 
to write the image to a floppy disk. Use the image as a source file and fdd as a destination device.
ISO images for bootable CD may also be created on the base of boot FDD images 
with the help of different software.
</p>
<h4>DOS Bootable Disk</h4>
<p>
Loading from the specific disk must be supported by BIOS (see BIOS boot menu).
To create bootable USB/HDD you need a freshly formatted primary FAT16/FAT32 partition on the disk.
Non-standard disks/partitions are not supported (non-MBR, 3TB+, etc.).
You may probably need to <a href="fillsectors.html">zero the disk</a> to properly create compatible primary FAT partition 
using standard OS means.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.</b>&nbsp;Download the <b>FreeDOS Package</b>
and unpack files into the root of the FAT partition.
<br />
<b>2.</b>&nbsp;Open the disk as <a href="devices.html">physical device</a> in DMDE
and use the command <span class="ii">Write Boot Sectors...</span> in the 
<a href="partitions.html">Partitions</a> menu to make the device bootable
(specify the location of unpacked files as a source of boot sectors).
Apply changes and close DMDE.
<br />
<b>3.</b>&nbsp;
&nbsp;Download DMDE for DOS and unpack into the FAT partition.
