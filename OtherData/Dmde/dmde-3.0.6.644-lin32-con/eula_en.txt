  END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

  This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement 
  between you (either a natural person or juridical entity) and 
  Dmitry Sidorov - the SOFTWARE author. By keeping, running or 
  otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms of 
  the EULA. If you do not agree or the EULA contradicts applicable law 
  you must cease all use of the SOFTWARE and destroy SOFTWARE copies.

  1. GRANT OF LICENSE

  1.0. EDITIONS
  
  The scope of granted rights depends on the EDITION (license type) 
  and the number of license copies provided for you. Under the terms 
  of other agreements between you and the SOFTWARE author you may be 
  provided with EDITIONS not mentioned in this EULA.

  In the "About" box you can see the EDITION, the number of copies, 
  and the maintenance (support) end date (call through the menu items 
  "Help", "About..."). If the number of copies is not specified 
  expressly then one (1) license is provided. If the maintenance end 
  date is not specified then there is no limit (see par. 1.4). The 
  number of OS families on which you may run the SOFTWARE is specified 
  in your license order.

  1.1. FREE EDITION

  The par. 1.1, 5, and 6 of the EULA are only applied for FREE EDITION.

  An unlimited number of FREE EDITION copies may be used for non-
  commercial purposes including educational purposes of institutions 
  and evaluation purposes. Only files from the current panel may be 
  recovered and no more than 4000 files at a time (per command call).

  You may reproduce and distribute FREE EDITION copies under the 
  following set of conditions only: the SOFTWARE is obtained from the 
  SOFTWARE author or got on the specified SOFTWARE websites; keys, 
  files, and other materials of other EDITIONS are not transmitted; 
  all SOFTWARE components are kept together, not modified (except 
  encoding into a different form), and available to an end-user; 
  an end-user is provided with the need to view and accept this EULA 
  when first run the SOFTWARE as designed originally; the SOFTWARE 
  origin and composition are not misrepresented.

  FREE EDITION may be distributed separately or included in freeware 
  or paid packages provided that its freeware origin is not hidden.

  1.2.1. EDITIONS "EXPRESS" AND "PERSONAL": PERSONAL USE ONLY

  With edition "EXPRESS" or "PERSONAL", you may use the SOFTWARE 
  functionality for personal non-commercial purposes only. The usage 
  in organizations and any direct or indirect benefit are prohibited. 

  1.2.2. STANDARD EDITION: USE FOR OWN NEEDS ONLY

  With STANDARD EDITION, you may use the SOFTWARE functionality as 
  a person or organization for own needs only. Data recovery services 
  for third parties are prohibited. In particular, any organization or 
  its employee or other person providing data recovery services may 
  not use the SOFTWARE.

  1.3. RUN ONE COPY PER LICENSE ONLY

  You may run simultaneously no more SOFTWARE instances (keep a number 
  of unfinished processes) than a number of provided license copies.

  Additionally you may create and keep two (2) backup copies. The copy 
  not running currently is a backup copy.

  1.4. ENVIRONMENT CHANGE RESTRICTIONS

  You may run the SOFTWARE on different hardware configurations not 
  exceeding the allowed number of configurations. The motherboard or 
  CPU change, the change of motherboard serial number stored in ROM, 
  the use of virtualization imply the change of hardware.

  For editions "EXPRESS" and "PERSONAL" the allowed number of 
  configurations is two (2) per year. For STANDARD EDITION it is 
  three (3) per year per license copy. The year is counted back from 
  the current date.

  The maintenance of EXPRESS EDITION is limited by time. If the 
  maintenance is over, you may continue using the SOFTWARE on the same 
  environment but maintenance and ensuring functioning (including 
  reactivation and other support) are not provided.

  2. ACTIVATION

  The SOFTWARE may require activation. You can use Online Activation 
  (if applicable) and Offline Activation (get the activation code on 
  the activation site). Some changes to your hardware or software may 
  cause the necessity to reactivate the SOFTWARE.

  Activation is designed to reveal and prevent an unlicensed use 
  of the SOFTWARE. You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent 
  activation or use other ways to hide an illegal SOFTWARE usage.

  3. SOFTWARE UPDATES

  When new versions are released older versions may become no longer 
  available. In such case you may use the succeeding available version 
  if the maintenance is continued for you, then the newer agreement 
  replaces the previous one in those stipulations only which clarify 
  the terms and explicitly enhance your rights. In other cases updates 
  may be used entirely under the terms of new license agreements only.

  You may use previous available SOFTWARE versions under the terms 
  of this EULA too. However running previous versions (considering the 
  number before the first dot) is regarded as a run on different 
  hardware configurations assuming the restrictions of the par. 1.4.

  4. SOFTWARE UPGRADES

  Upgrade is a change of the complete set, the number of licenses, or 
  license conditions. To apply the SOFTWARE upgrade, you must first be 
  licensed for the SOFTWARE that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon 
  upgrade, the new agreement supersedes all previous agreements. After 
  upgrade you may no longer use the SOFTWARE you upgraded from.

  5. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS

  You may not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or create 
  derivative work based on the SOFTWARE, except as granted by law.

  You may not use the SOFTWARE otherwise than expressly provided by 
  the EULA. You may not sell, rent, lease or sublicense the SOFTWARE. 
  Violation of any EULA terms automatically terminates the EULA and 
  your rights to use the SOFTWARE.

  The SOFTWARE author retains all the rights of the author.

  6. LIMITED WARRANTY

  THE AUTHOR OF THE SOFTWARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY FOR 
  THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION IS 
  PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES

  PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE REMAINS WITH YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
  THE AUTHOR OF THE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER 
  ARISING OUT OF USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING

  PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, 
  PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER 
  LOSS WHATSOEVER), EVEN IF THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
